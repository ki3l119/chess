# Shared Types

This package contains the TypeScript types used by both the `chess-server` and `chess-client` package. These types are usually the DTOs used by both the server and client when communicating via HTTP or WebSockets. Since the package only exports types, no build step is needed and it can be used directly by simply importing from `chess-shared-types` within the project.
